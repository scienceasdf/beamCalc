Sport plays a prominent role in English life. Popular teams sports in England are association football, field hockey, cricket, rugby union, and rugby league. Major individual sports include badminton, athletics, tennis, boxing, golf, cycling, motorsport and horseracing. A number of modern sports were codified in England during the nineteenth century, among them cricket, rugby union, rugby league, football, field hockey, squash, tennis, and badminton. The game of baseball was first described in 18th century England. At the same time, England played a key role in the evolution of modern boxing, with the codification of the rules of the sport known as the Queensberry Rules in the 19th century.
There are four sports in England which operate high profile professional leagues. Association football is by far the most popular sport and is played from August to May. Rugby union is also a winter sport. Cricket is played in the Summer, from April to September. Rugby league is traditionally a winter sport, but since the late 1990s the elite competition has been played in the summer to appeal to the family market, and take advantage of the faster pitches. There is also a professional ice hockey league in Britain called the Elite Ice Hockey League. Each of these made great economic value for the country.
Of course boxing and MMA are popular in England, though less popular compared with football. In fact,  we can see clearly that the professional boxing market can make great benefits. And also the markets of MMA is also rising.
